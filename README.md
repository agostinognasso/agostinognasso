# Hi there, I'm Agostino Gnasso! 👋

### Ph.D. in Economics | Data Scientist | R Developer

I am a Researcher based at the **University of Naples Federico II** (Department of Economics and Statistics). My work stands at the intersection of **Statistics**, **Economics**, and **Machine Learning**, with a strong focus on model interpretability and software development.

---

### Research Focus
My primary interest lies in **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** and **Explainable Machine Learning (XML)**. I develop statistical methods and tools to make complex algorithms—especially **decision trees**—transparent and actionable for decision-making in economics and beyond.

* I’m currently working on **interpretable machine learning models** and **R packages**.
* I’m a core member of the **[Bibliometrix](https://www.bibliometrix.org)** research team and the academic spin-off **[K-Synth](https://www.k-synth.unina.it)**.
* I was a Visiting Scholar at **Leiden University** (Department of Methodology and Statistics).
